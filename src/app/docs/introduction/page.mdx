# Authentication

Cal.com uses <span style={{ color: "#0b79d0", fontWeight: "bold" }}>API keys</span> to authenticate all API requests. This ensures that only authorized clients can access your account and perform operations. API keys can be viewed and managed in your account under the <span style={{ color: "#0b79d0", fontWeight: "bold" }}>Security</span> settings.

## 🔑 API Key Types

    Start with: <span style={{ color: "#27ae60", fontWeight: "bold" }}>cal\_</span>

-   **Live Mode Keys**: <span style={{ color: "#e74c3c" }}>Used for production.</span>

        paddingLeft: "12px",
        color: "#e67e22",
        backgroundColor: "#fff8e1",
    }}

    ⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Keep your API keys secure! Never share them publicly or commit
    them to version control. Treat them like passwords.

## 🛠️ How to Use API Keys

You can authenticate your requests either by **query parameter** or **HTTP header**. Using headers is recommended for security.

### 1. Query Parameter

Append the `apiKey` to your request URL:

```bash
curl "https://api.cal.com/v1/endpoint?apiKey=cal_live_xxxxxx"
```
